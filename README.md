## Icons Website Web Scraping and Data Analysis
This project involves web scraping raw data from the Icons website, focusing on collecting data for items from players with surnames beginning with A-C. The analysis aims to determine which player's signature is worth the most. Various numerical analyses are conducted, accompanied by visualizations to illustrate results and conclusions.

1. Data Extraction:
The data_extraction.py script uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML content and extract relevant information for each item, including player name, item description, and price. The data is then saved to a CSV file (raw_data.csv).

2. Data Analysis:
The data_analysis.py script reads the extracted data and performs several numerical analyses, such as calculating average prices, identifying the highest-priced signatures, and more. The script also generates visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate the findings.

3. Visualizations:
The analysis includes various visualizations to help understand the data and draw conclusions, such as:
 a. Bar charts showing the average prices of signatures
 b. Scatter plots highlighting the distribution of signature prices
 c. Histograms illustrating the frequency of different price ranges
 
 4. Results:
The primary goal of this project is to identify which player's signature is worth the most among those with surnames beginning with A-C. The results and conclusions are based on the numerical analysis and visualizations generated by the data_analysis.py script.
